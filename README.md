- ðŸ”­ I'm looking for my first work experience in the technology field, with a priority on trainee or internship.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying Computer Science at Unip, on the Alphaville campus.
- ðŸŽ’ I studied Electrical Engineering for four years, but for personal reasons, I decided to switch fields.
- ðŸ“˜ Although I find back-end development easier, I have developed a greater affinity for front-end and data science.
- ðŸŒµ I use my free time to take courses and certifications that help me gain knowledge and experience in most areas involving front-end and SQL, through in-person workshops or online courses on platforms like Alura.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me **pedrolucas_14oliveira@hotmail.com**
